# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version (this sample assumes Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ```
 
  This will generate a file named `jakartaee-hello-world.war`. You should be able to run the application by deploying the file to
  a [Jakarta EE compatible runtime](https://jakarta.ee/compatibility).
